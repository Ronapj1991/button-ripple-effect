This project involved creating a button and making the hover effect ripple through the button depending on which way you hover your mouse through.

This project taught me a few things:
1. How to create a simple transition
2. It helped me see and understand the before pseudo class
3. I did not know that it is possible to change the existing css styling particularly the transition through the DOM
4. Learned about event.pageX and event.pageY
5. Learned about HTMLelement.offsetTop and HTMLelement.offsetLeft
